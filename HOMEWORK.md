This is an API that provides a list of services available in London.

Buttons for each 'area', when a area button is clicked, you should make a request to download that area's information, then present it on screen.

While the request is happening, you should display a 'loading' indicator (just the word will do).
Once it is completed, remove the 'loading' indicator, and present the results.

To get a list of areas, first make a request to `https://code-your-future.github.io/api-demo/area/index.json`
Using that list, create buttons for each area.
Clicking on of those buttons should then make another request to get that area, and display the results.

To get the data from a specific area, replace `<AREA>` in the below URL, with the area you want to get the data for.
`https://code-your-future.github.io/api-demo/area/<AREA>/index.json`

For example, to get the data for 'All', the URL becomes: `https://code-your-future.github.io/api-demo/area/All/index.json`


It would also be good to see, when a button is pressed and the results shown, if you click the same button again, the results are hidden.
Also if you click another button, it hides the results shown, and shows the new results
